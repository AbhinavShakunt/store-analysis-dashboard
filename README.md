## Overview

This project involved conducting a thorough analysis of store data using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The dataset contained sales data for a period of 12 months, including information on product types, sales amounts, purchase addresses, and more.

## Key Highlights

- **Data Cleaning:** The project started with data cleaning tasks, including:
  - Dropping NaN values from the DataFrame to ensure data integrity.
  - Removing rows based on specific conditions to enhance data quality.
  - Changing column types using methods like `to_numeric`, `to_datetime`, and `astype` to prepare the data for analysis.

- **Business Questions:** Explored five high-level business questions related to the data:
  - **Best Month for Sales:** Determined the best month for sales and calculated the earnings for that month.
  - **Top-Selling City:** Identified the city with the highest sales of products.
  - **Optimal Advertisement Timing:** Analyzed the data to find the best time for displaying advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customer purchases.
  - **Frequently Sold Products:** Investigated which products were most often sold together.
  - **Best-Selling Product:** Determined the product that sold the most and provided insights into why it was the top seller.

- **Data Analysis Techniques:** Utilized various Pandas and Matplotlib methods, including:
  - Concatenating multiple CSV files to create a unified DataFrame.
  - Parsing cells as strings to create new columns.
  - Using the `.apply()` method for custom data transformations.
  - Employing `groupby` for aggregate analysis.
  - Visualizing results through bar charts and line graphs.
  - Adding labels to graphs for clear presentation.

- **Data-Driven Decision-Making:** The project aimed to provide actionable insights for the business, enabling informed decisions regarding sales strategies and product offerings.
